## Programs covered in the repository are as follows :

Implementation of              | File name 
------------------------------ | ----------
Cohen Sutherland Line Clipping algorithm | cohen.cpp
Bresenham Line drawing algorithm | bresenham_line.cpp
Bresenham Circle drawing algorithm | bresenham_circle.cpp
Midpoint Circle drwaing algorithm | midpoint_circle.cpp
Midpoint Ellipse drwaing algorithm | midpoint_ellipse.cpp
2d translation | 2d_transformations_all.cpp
2d rotation | 2d_transformations_all.cpp
2d scaling | 2d_transformations_all.cpp
2d rotation about an arbitary line | 2d_transformations_all.cpp
Bouncing ball | bouncing_ball.cpp
Implementation of bezier curve algorithm | bezier_curve.cpp
Liang Barsky Line Clipping algorithm | liang_barsky.cpp
Rotating and color changing coin | rotating_coin.cpp
Cyrus Beck Line Clipping algorithm | cyrus_beck.cpp

**Note** 
Header file implementation have the whole program wrapped in the header file template. Hence only a single header file is needed. 
I was facing trouble in linking hence the reason i decided to go with this.
