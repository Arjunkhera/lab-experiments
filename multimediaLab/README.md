#### Important :
1. Those who were facing troubles in Arithmetic encoding, I have found the error.   
It seems, in c++ floating subtraction, say 0.5 == 0.5 may not be true, and hence can give errors.    
Check this for clarification   [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12700018/subtracting-double-gives-wrong-result)

2. Have made a proper new LZW program .

3. Problems with Dynamic Huffman still persist, though minor ones.
