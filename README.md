# Repository of Lab Codes

### Updates

***12 June 2019***  
This repository will be taking a break, given that I have now graduated and will be busy with work at the office. 
I would make sure that the juniors at my college are made aware of the existence of this set of codes. It would
be great if this repository can help anyone out there.  

As stated above, contributions from my side are mostly going to be negligible or non existent. However, I would 
urge any fellow developer, especially if you are in college and you find this respositry useful, **do consider adding to it and
expanding it further**. There are still many portions that can take benefit of refinement and clarity.    

If you have any suggestions, find a bug, or just want to say hey drop me a note at [@arjunk30](https://twitter.com/arjunk30) on Twitter or by email at workarjunk@gmail.com.  

Happy Coding :relaxed:
