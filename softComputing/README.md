# Soft Computing Lab

This repository contains the codes for the experiments of Soft Computing Lab.  

## How to Run the programs

Check manual.md

## List of experiments

- [x] Using Neural Network Perform the implementation of AND, NAND, OR, and NOR

- [x] Using Neural Network Perform any two class classification Problem

- [x] Using Neural Network Implement Perceptron Learning Algorithm

- [ ] Using Neural Network Perform the implementation of XOR and XNOR

- [x] Implement McCulloch-Pits Neural Network

- [x] Implement Hebb Net Network

- [x] Implement Adaline Network

- [ ] Implement Backpropagation used in  neural networks

- [x] Implement Auto Associative Neural Networks

- [x] Implement Heteroassociative Neural Network

- [ ] Implement recurrent neural network (RNN)

- [ ] Any application based on any model of Neural Networks

## To Do

- [ ] Add a function to store the model outputs as a csv file.
- [x] Change Hebb to accept n number of features instead of 2. Follow the example of Perceptron class.
